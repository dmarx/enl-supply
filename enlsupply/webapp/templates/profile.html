      Sorry, we can't help you here.<br><br>
      
      If you connect to {{ agent_name }}, this space will be replaced with a form 
      that will let you send a direct-message on GroupMe. You aren't
      currently connected, so if you want to contact them you'll have to figure
      out another way to get the message out.<br><br>
      
      We apologize for the inconvenience. In the future, this feature will be available
      for any agents you share a GroupMe group with, but at this time you need to be
      connected.
